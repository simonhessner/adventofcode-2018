# Advent of Code 2018 solutions
I will share my personal solutions for the problems presented in the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) coding competition here. My code is written in Python 3. Also check my [blog article about AOC18](https://simonhessner.de/advent-of-code-2018-25-days-of-coding/).

For the first time ever I made it to the leaderboard for part 1 on [day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/7) [place 69]:-)
However, part 2 took me way too long and I only got rank 475
